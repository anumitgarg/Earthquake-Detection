# Earthquake-Detection
The project was aimed at developing a mobile, battery powered earthquake and fire detection hardware module.
The module was developed using an arduino UNO microcontroller interfaced with a GSM Module, Inertial measurement unit, Gas-sensor and a buzzer. In case of occurance of fire or earthquake (detected through the vibration in earth's surface) the module sends a stress signal to any number of preset contacts along with the location. 
The primary task of the module is to make sure that each accident gets the medical aid at the earliest.
